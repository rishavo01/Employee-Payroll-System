## 📌 Project Overview

This project manages employee information and calculates salaries based on different employee types. It uses OOP principles to make the system modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

### ✔️ Encapsulation
- Private fields such as `name`, `id`, `salary`, etc.
- Public getter & setter methods

### ✔️ Inheritance
- Base class: `Employee`
- Child classes: e.g. `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`, `Intern`

### ✔️ Polymorphism
- Method overriding for salary calculation
- `calculateSalary()` method behaves differently for each employee type

### ✔️ Abstraction
- Abstract class or interface for `Employee` to enforce structure
